            <p>
                Eric is a selfish young man who hates, uses and manipulates other
                people. He done horriblr things in his life one of the them being
                the anti-jew campaign where he conspired to drive the jewish people
                out of South Park and failed miserably at that. He also participated
                in para-lympics by pretending to be disabled.
